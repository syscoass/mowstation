This project has two major components:

1) Arduino code which handles taking over control of a wheel chair joysticks functionality.

2) Java base station code which handles control of a remote camera, TCP commands to a DD-WRT router running ser2net (WRT54GL v1.1 router has arduino connected to /dev/tty/1), and Joystick input for control of the remote mower.
